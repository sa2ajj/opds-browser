Simple browser for OPDS catalogues
==================================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Introduction
------------

This is a simple browser for `OPDS`_ catalogues.

This application is just an experiment with:

    * `PyQt`_
    * `ElementTree`_
    * `OPDS`_

(Small link to myself: `OPDS`_ is based on `Atom`_.)

Installation
------------

You should be able to obtain the latest version of the code in a git repository at `gitorious`_.

This is a work in progress, so there are not real installation instructions yet, sorry.

Pre-requisites:

    * python (>= 2.5)
    * PyQt 4.x

.. _gitorious: http://gitorious.org/opds-browser

Credits
-------

In the application were used `black and white`_ icons by Lothar Grimme.
