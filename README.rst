Introduction
------------

This is a simple browser for `OPDS`_ catalogs.

This application is just an experiment with:

    * `PyQt`_
    * `ElementTree`_
    * `OPDS`_

(Small link to myself: `OPDS`_ is based on `Atom`_.)

Credits
-------

In the application were used `black and white`_ icons by Lothar Grimme.
